I thought I'd try my hand at revamping my webpage into something Jekyll based. I wanted to go for something simpler than what I had. I really don't have many thoughts right now but hopefully I will be able to blog about my summer adventures interning in NYC as a hackNY class of 2013 fellow. Until then!

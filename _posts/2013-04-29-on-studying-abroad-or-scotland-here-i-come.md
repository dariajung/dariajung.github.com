title: "On Studying Abroad: Hi Scotland."
category: posts

Spring of Junior year is a time often reserved for restless college students seeking to spend a semester abroad in a completely new environment, whether to get "cultured" (whatever that means), or to have an excuse to live it up without ~~too many~~ reprecussions (Pass/Fail classes baby). 

So I guess you might have guessed by now that I am studying abroad. Yes, sirs and ma'ams, I plan on leaving the disorienting reality that is NYC for the quiet seaside town of St. Andrews, Scotland. And I'm doing it even though I'm an engineering student! Take that, stereotypes.

While abroad, I plan to take:

	Artificial Intelligence
	Databases
	Intro. to Statistics
	ODEs (?)

Somewhere along the way, I psyched myself out into thinking that I needed to take 5/6 classes every semester to graduate on time. This ended up being a blessing in disguise, because now I am far along enough in my classes that I have the luxury of studying abroad (and take only 3 or 4 classes while being abroad), come back, and still be fine taking only 4 classes both semesters senior year. 

Who would have thought I could ever take 4 classes per semester. 

Dreams do come true.

Daughter, one of my favorite folk indie bands recently did a cover of Daft Punk's 'Get Lucky' for the BBC's Live Lounge. 

I had the pleasure of seeing Daughter at a sold out concert at the Bowery Ballroom. Unfortunately, they did not perform this cover, but the show was incredible regardless. Elena Tonra's voice is simply beautiful, the band's instrumentation is ethereal, and their lyrics will make you quiver.

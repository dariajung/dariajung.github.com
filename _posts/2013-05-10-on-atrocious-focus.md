Man oh man. It's finals season here at Columbia. And as the title suggests, I am having a rough time concentrating on my studies. Maybe it's the weather *finally* turning nice. Or maybe it's the shitstorm of a week Columbia's been having (racist hate crimes, cheating scandals, more cheating scandals). Whatever it is, I am having an atrocious time focusing.

So what else to do but blog? I'm still not very good at this whole write what I'm thinking thing. My music "blog", if you can call it that, on Tumblr is just pictures and sound uploads which makes everything pretty simple, but this seems like another beast.

My mind is pretty crazy right now (obviously not with school things, as we have established). I'm so stoked for the summer. I'm still not completely sure what startup I will end up with as part of my hackNY fellowship, but I met with two co-founders of a startup [name witheld until a final decision is made] yesterday morning for breakfast, and it was an amazing experience. They've had some exciting news recently, which has resulted in a mass influx of users, and they're planning on scaling in the next 8 weeks. They're hiring more devs and the team is growing. It's an exciting time for them and I would love to be a part of it.

I should probably start studying for my exams next week. I had one today. Now four to go! ;(

Oh, and yesterday, I went to check my mail, and this thing was in my mailbox:

How cute. I have no idea who sent it. Reveal yourself, friend! 
It made my day a whole lot better while I was scrambling to study for my Major Topics in East Asian Civilizations final.

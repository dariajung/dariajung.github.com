Sophomore year of university is over (huzzah!), and I have been spending the last few days at home before I head back to New York for my summer life as a hackNY fellow and as a software engineering intern at [Bloglovin'](http://bloglovin.com/en). On that note, I've been doing a few things, which have included shopping (gotta look good if I'm interning at a startup with connections to fashion), learning (Python and JavaScript), reading, and catching up on some shows and movies (Star Trek Into Darkness!).

Home has been relaxing, although to be frank, a bit boring. I suppose that's what happens when one can't walk around the city or hop on a subway at one's whim.

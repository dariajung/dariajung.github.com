title: "HackNY Adventures: Day 9"

It's been over a week since I've moved into NYU's Palladium dorm for a summer of craziness as a hackNY 2013 fellow!

Move-in day was actually a lot more complicated than I expected. I arrived in NYC the night before and ended up staying
up for most of the night, checking in around 4am. I felt pretty terrible for being *that guy* and the poor 
RA on duty had to come down to get me sorted. Nonetheless, the first day ended up being pretty busy, checking out
the amenities and meeting everyone. My roommate Sana is amazing, and we both like cats. :3 

I'm working at the Betaworks office this summer at Swedish start-up [Bloglovin'](http://bloglovin.com). They are a fashion-content focused RSS 
Reader, but also serve as a discovery platform. If you're looking for a Google Reader replacement, check it out, maybe?

Work has been pretty interesting, learning new languages and just working with a very large codebase is definitely
a new thing for me. I'm just used to working with very small Flask or Rails apps for hackathons so this is a new
can of worms. Also I've been delving a bit into the world of frontend dev, and it is a bit terrifying, to be honest.
But hopefully I will be competent at it at the end of the summer!  

This past weekend, I volunteered for the Governor's Ball; I worked 15 hours over the weekend for 3-day passes to the
festival. Friday was a bit of a mess with the rain storm and the festival grounds were so muddy I ended up being calf
deep in it for most of the time I was walking around. People definitely lost their shoes and many people were walking
barefoot. Ahhhh. It was a fun weekend, though. I ended up seeing: Alt-J, Azealia Banks, Dirty Projectors, Cold War Kids,
Kings of Leon, Foals, Twin Shadow, Beirut, Lumineers, Grizzly Bear, Kanye West, the xx, and the Avett Brothers.

I also unofficially "saw" Haim and met Este Haim and met Arni from the Vaccines working at catering. Pretty surreal!

Going back to work on Monday was a bit rough, but it was a small price to pay for a good weekend.

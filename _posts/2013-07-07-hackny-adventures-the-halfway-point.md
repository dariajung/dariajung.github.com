It's just a little over the halfway point of hackNY. I'm kind of amazed by how quickly the summer is going. 
From working, to spending evenings listening to speakers from the hackNY lecture series, to just exploring the city,
time is flowing a little too quickly. Being in NYC during the summer is way different from being here during
the school year, where I feel myself sinking under the pressures of school.

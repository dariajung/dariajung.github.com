It's just a little over the halfway point of hackNY. I'm kind of amazed by how quickly the summer is going. 
From working, to spending evenings listening to speakers from the hackNY lecture series, to just exploring the city,
time is flowing a little too quickly. Being in NYC during the summer is way different from being here during
the school year, where I feel myself sinking under the pressures of school.

<center>Here's a photo recap of what I've been up to:

**Neil Gaiman, Uncovered** at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. 
He said he liked my hair but I was so flustered 

that all I could tell him was that I loved following him on Tumblr.

Hack the Met, a VIP tour of the Met which 'hacks' the Met to see the Met afterhours.

There's a dead deer under those glass balls.
Creepy, but beautiful.

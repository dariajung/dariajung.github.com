 <h1>Hello, friend.</h1></br>

  I study Computer Science at <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a> (SEAS '15).</br></br>
    hackathons == fun;</br>
    school != fun;</br></br>

    I do things on campus:</br></br>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://adicu.com/">the Application Development Initiative</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/wics/">Women in Computer Science</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/philo/">the Philolexian Society</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/german/">Work Study @ the Germanic Languages Department</a></li>
    </ul>

    I was originally an Environmental Engineering major who took an intro Java class, which was intriguing enough for me to take OOP. Then  I went to <a href="http://hackny.org/a/">hackNY</a>, which finally converted me into majoring in CS.</br></br>
  
    I like using vim. I know Java, C, a wee bit of C++, and some Python and Ruby. I've used Rails, Flask, and Django. Git and github are cool. I like iTerm and the z-shell. I have a decent grasp of Photoshop CS5 & CS6, and can do basic things with CSS and JavaScript.</br></br>

    This summer, I will be a class of 2013 <a href="http://hackny.org/a/">hackNY fellow</a>!</br></br>

    I enjoy shooting with my film SLR camera, people watching, getting invested into British television programmes (the Hour, Doctor Who, the Inbetweeners, My Mad Fat Diary, etc.), listening to music, going to music festivals, reading (Neil Gaiman, David Mitchell, and Haruki Murakami are among my favorite authors), and drinking a good cup of tea. Sometimes I blog about music on <a href="http://fuckyeahrandombritishindiebands.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>. I've got about 10,000 followers, but I'm not sure if what I do on there actually counts as blogging.</br></br>

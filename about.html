   <h2>About Me</h2>

   Hello! I study Computer Science and (and tentatively) Applied Mathematics at Columbia University.
   <br></br>I LOVE GOING TO HACKATHONS!<br></br>
            On campus, I can be found at:<br></br>
            <li><a href="http://adicu.com/">Application Development Initiative at Columbia University</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/wics/">Columbia Women in Computer Science</a></li>

            <br>

            I became interested in CS after a tussle with an intro Java class my first semester freshman year at Columbia. The next semester, I dropped General Chemistry II to take Object Oriented Programming. A few weeks later, I attended my first hackathon, hackNY. The combination of those things helped me decide that CS is awesome.
            <br></br>
            I use vim, hooray! I've done most of my CS classes in Java, but last semester I learned a bit of Ruby by taking a Ruby on Rails class. This semester, I am learning C and C++ in Advanced Programming. My goal is to learn some Python through Zed Shaw's LPTHW. I have a friend who thinks I should learn CLisp, so we'll see.<br></br>

            I pursue photography as a hobby, shooting in both film and digital. I utilize a Canon AE-1 Film SLR, a Canon EOS 350D DSLR, and a Lomography Fisheye Film camera. I enjoy British television programmes, watching films, and reading. Haruki Murakami and Neil Gaiman are among my favorite authors. I am a British Indie music enthusiast, and I love attending music festivals, such as Lollapalooza and Osheaga. Glastonbury is on my bucket list.
